# Automated GrowBox for mushrooms project
## Overview
The aim of this project is to implement an automated grow box for mushrooms using **Arduino**. The original idea has been designed by a collaboration between [PLAM Creative Studio](https://www.plamstudio.eu/) and [Phylor](https://www.phylor.it/), for the [PoliPolo](https://www.plamstudio.eu/polipolo/) Fab Lab, in which the grow box has been exposed from the 29<sup>th</sup> of April 2022 in the Laboratorio Aperto di Ferrara.

I used this opportunity not only to gain experience but also to develop a project for the Electronics for Applied Physics' course in the University of Bologna. 

After some hours of work, this was final result:

Pretty cool, isn't it? :heart_eyes:

To download the slides of the project in order to have a global overview you can click [here](https://github.com/keivan-amini/Automated-Grow-Box-for-mushrooms-project/raw/main/Automated%20GrowBox%20for%20Mushrooms%20-%20PDF.pdf).

## Tools required for the project
* Arduino UNO
* Breadbord, resistors, jumper wires
* DHT11 sensor 
* LCD display
* 4-channel Relay
* 4 led grow lights
* Ultrasonic atomiser
* Fan (optional: potentiometer)
* Heat mat
* 4,7 KÎ© resistor
* Power strip

Of course if you haven't it yet, you will need to install Arduino Software; detailed instructions for installation in popular operating systems can be found [here](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino).

## What to do
### Electronics

First of all, you will need to connect the sensors to the Arduino UNO. The [DHT 11](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/758/DHT11-Technical-Data-Sheet-Translated-Version-1143054.pdf) sensor allows us to measure the temperature and the humidity of an environment and it is composed by 4 pins as you can see in the following picture:

</p>

Where the meaning of the different pins is given by:
* **VCC**: 3.5V to 5.5V;
* **DATA**: outputs both temperature and humidity through serial data;
* **NC**: no connection (not used);
* **GROUND**: connected to the ground of the circuit.

As an example of the electronic connections you could just copy the electronics of the following picture, *but be careful: in the software implementation the pins connected are not the same!* Eventually, just remember to look and change some small parts of the main code.

In the next step we have to connect the LCD display. We used an 20x4 character display with an onboard potentiometer which controls the brightness of the display. Altough we used a breadbord, an illustrative image of the connection is given by:

Often when we have to deal with displays in electronics, it is way more confortable to use libraries instead of coding everything by-hand. For this reason we implemeted the LCD display by using a library called `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h` for which you can install it from this simple [repository](https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library). For the same reason we have used another library for the [DHT11](https://github.com/adidax/dht11).

It is now time to consider the relay: an important tools when we have to deal with normal voltage electronics. We have used a 4-channel relay for which we have two different side:

**High voltage side**
* NO: Normally Open
* COM: Common
* NC: Normally Closed

**Low voltage side**
* GND
* IN1: Atomiser
* IN2: Fan
* IN3: Light
* IN4: Heat mat
* VCC

We actually used Normally Open connections. That means, when we tell Arduino to output an HIGH signal the current will not flow. Otherwise, when we tell Arduino to output a LOW signal, the current will flow. I personally recommend this [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-relay-module-with-arduino/) for those who did not understand how a relay works.
