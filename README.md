# Automated GrowBox for mushrooms project
## Overview
The aim of this project is to implement an automated grow box for mushrooms using **Arduino**. The original idea has been designed by a collaboration between [PLAM Creative Studio](https://www.plamstudio.eu/) and [Phylor](https://www.phylor.it/), for the [PoliPolo](https://www.plamstudio.eu/polipolo/) Fab Lab, in which the grow box has been exposed from the 29<sup>th</sup> of April 2022 in the Laboratorio Aperto di Ferrara.

I used this opportunity not only to gain experience but also to develop a project for the Electronics for Applied Physics' course in the University of Bologna. 

After some hours of work, this was final result:
